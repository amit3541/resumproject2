    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Amit Kumar, a dedicated and detail-oriented Software Tester with a passion for ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. With 2 of experience in both manual and automated testing, I have a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle and a strong commitment to delivering exceptional user experiences.

        Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from small-scale applications to large enterprise systems, ensuring that they meet rigorous performance, functionality, and security standards. My expertise lies in [specific skills, e.g., writing test cases, performing regression testing, and using automation tools like Selenium and JIRA].
        
        I thrive in fast-paced environments, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and keen eye for detail to identify issues early and contribute to delivering robust and high-quality software. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and improve processes to help teams deliver the best possible products.
        
        When I’m not testing software, I enjoy Long Drive, e.g., exploring new technologies, gaming, reading], and I’m always up for a new challenge.
        
        Let’s connect and discuss how I can help ensure the success of your next project!</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my recent projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> 5G Network Implementation and Optimization Project
            The 5G Network Implementation and Optimization Project focuses on designing, deploying, and optimizing 5G cellular networks to provide enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This project leverages advanced technologies like millimeter waves (mmWave), small cells, massive MIMO, and network slicing to deliver faster speeds, greater capacity, and more reliable connectivity than previous generations of wireless networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> 4G LTE Network Deployment and Optimization Project
            The 4G LTE Network Deployment and Optimization Project focuses on enhancing mobile broadband access through the deployment and optimization of 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology. This project seeks to deliver high-speed internet services, improved voice quality (VoLTE), and reliable connectivity to users in both urban and rural areas, with a particular emphasis on expanding network reach and capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 3:</strong>3G Mobile Network Deployment and Modernization Project
            The 3G Mobile Network Deployment and Modernization Project aims to expand and enhance mobile broadband services using third-generation (3G) wireless technology. The project focuses on increasing data speeds, improving voice services, and expanding network coverage to underserved areas, supporting both voice and data communications.</li>
